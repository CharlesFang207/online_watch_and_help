As for the spoon, it\\'s in the kitchen cabinet, but again, I\\'m not certain about some other places,\" Alice responded while heading towards the wineglass. Kevin grabbed a wineglass as Alice grabbed another one.\\n\\nKevin walked to the kitchen table and placed the wineglass on it, while Alice grabbed a second wineglass and walked to the kitchen cabinet. Kevin then walked to the kitchen cabinet and opened it, while Alice opened the same cabinet. Kevin proceeded to open another kitchen cabinet as Alice opened yet another one. Kevin then opened the dishwasher while Alice put the wineglass on the kitchen table.\\n\\nKevin grabbed a spoon from the dishwasher and put it on the kitchen table, while Alice opened the fridge.
