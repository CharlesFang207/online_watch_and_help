Kevin opened the kitchen cabinet and asked, \"Do you have any idea where the wine, milk, and the wineglass might be?\" Emily responded, \"I spotted the wine inside the cabinet in the bedroom, but I\\'m not sure where the other wine is. The milk is nicely chilled inside the kitchen cabinet. There\\'s quite a collection of wine glasses inside the cabinet in the bedroom, on the stove and in the kitchen cabinet, and one more on the coffee table in the living room. However, there are also some wine glasses that I can\\'t seem to find.\"\\n\\nKevin proceeded to open the stove while Emily walked to the stove and opened it. Kevin then opened another kitchen cabinet as Emily walked to the kitchen cabinet and opened it. Kevin opened the microwave while Emily walked to the wineglass.
