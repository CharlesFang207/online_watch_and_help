Emily, grabbing a carrot, responded, \"I spotted some bread inside the kitchen cabinet, but some places where the bread could be are unknown to me. Also, it looks like there might be some bread in the cabinet in the bedroom and even in the bathroom cabinet. As for the carrots, they\\'re quite the movers! I saw one in the kitchen cabinet, but then I wasn\\'t sure where the rest of the carrots were for a bit. Luckily, I found them again in the kitchen cabinet a few more times. There\\'s even a carrot on the sofa in the living room!\"\\n\\nKevin opened another kitchen cabinet while Emily walked to the bread.
