Kevin walked to a folder in the kitchen, grabbed it, and inspected several kitchen cabinets and the fridge, then the dishwasher. He then walked to the bedroom, grabbed another folder and moved both folders to the desk in the bedroom. Next, he returned to the kitchen, opened several cabinets and the stove, and then returned to bedroom, opened a cabinet and grabbed two remote controls. He placed those remote controls on the desk in the bedroom. After that, he moved between the living room and the bedroom again and placed another folder and a book on the same desk. Next, he grabbed a remote control and moved to the bathroom.

Meanwhile, Emma walked to the bathroom cabinet and opened it. She then walked to the bedroom, grabbed the book and folder that Kevin previously placed, and moved them to a desk in the bedroom. Moving through the bedroom several times, she eventually grabbed another remote control that Kevin placed earlier and moved it to the same desk.
