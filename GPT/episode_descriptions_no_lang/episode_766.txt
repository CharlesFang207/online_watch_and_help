David walked into the kitchen and approached the stove. He opened it, grabbed a carrot, and moved to the fridge. After opening the fridge, he placed the carrot inside. Moving to the microwave next, he grabbed a milk carton and also placed it inside the fridge. He then walked to another carrot and grabbed it, heading back to the fridge to place it inside. Finally, he walked to a kitchen cabinet, opened it to grab another milk carton, and put that in the fridge too.

Later, Sarah walked to the carrot that was placed previously by David, grabbed it, and another carrot and placed them on the kitchen table. She then approached the bread, grabbed one, and moved it to the kitchen table. She did the same with another bread, placing it on the kitchen table too.
