Kevin walked to a milk carton, grabbed it, and then picked up a wineglass. He headed to the kitchen, placed the milk on the kitchen table, and then walked to the bedroom. There, he grabbed a bottle of wine and returned to the kitchen to place the wine next to the milk on the kitchen table.

Later on, Sarah went to the kitchen, grabbing a wineglass. She then walked to the milk carton that Kevin previously moved and grabbed it. She headed to the living room and placed both the wineglass and the milk on the coffee table. Afterwards, she returned to the kitchen, opening the fridge, stove, and multiple kitchen cabinets along the way. Finally, after exploring the kitchen and not finding what she wanted, she walked to the bedroom, grabbed a beer which she brought to living room and placed on the coffee table next to the milk.
