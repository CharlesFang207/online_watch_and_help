David walked to the notes, grabbed one and moved it to his desk, then walked to the folder and grabbed it. Then he moved back to his desk and placed both the notes and folder. Next, he walked to the remote control, grabbed it, and returned to the desk to place the remote control.

Later, Sarah walked to the folder and notes that David previously placed. She grabbed both the folder and notes and walked to the coffeetable, placing them there. She then went to the kitchen, opened the fridge and several kitchen cabinets, then explored additional areas like the stove, microwave, bathroom, and bedroom.

Sarah continued by grabbing notes from the bedroom and placing them on the coffeetable. She repeated this, walking back to the bedroom, grabbing another set of notes, and placing them on the coffeetable in the living room, finishing her actions.
