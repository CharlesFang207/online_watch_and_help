Dan walked over to a magazine, grabbed two folders, and headed to the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. He eventually went to a desk, placing both folders there. He then walked to the living room, picked up a magazine and a new folder, returned to the desk, and placed the magazine down.

Lily later went to a kitchen cabinet, opened several kitchen cabinets, the microwave, and the dishwasher, then checked a fridge and other kitchen cabinets again. She walked to the bathroom and the bedroom cabinet, opening it, then returned to grab a folder and magazine Dan previously placed. She moved these items to the kitchen table and placed them down. She continued to check the bathroom cabinet and walked back to the living room to grab another magazine, and moved it to the kitchen table as well.
