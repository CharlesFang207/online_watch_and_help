James walked into the kitchen, headed to the stove, and opened it. He grabbed a carrot and placed it on the kitchen table. He then opened the fridge, grabbed two potatoes one by one, and placed them on the same table. Next, James walked towards a potato, grabbed it, and placed it on the kitchen table before heading to the bathroom.

Later, Sarah walked into the kitchen, grabbed a carrot that James placed on the kitchen table, and moved it to the kitchen counter. She continued to place carrots at the kitchen counter repeatedly until the kitchen counter was filled with carrots that James earlier placed on the kitchen table.
