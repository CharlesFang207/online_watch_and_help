Kevin also opened another cabinet before grabbing a wine glass and walking to the living room. He put the spoon on the coffee table and returned to the kitchen.

Back in the kitchen, Kevin opened the stove, walked to another cabinet, and quickly checked multiple cabinets. Meanwhile, Emma remained inactive. Kevin then proceeded to the fridge, the microwave, and more kitchen cabinets until he grabbed a juice container. He walked back to the living room and placed the juice on the coffee table. 

Later, Emma walked into the kitchen, grabbed a wine glass, and put it in the dishwasher. She then went to the living room, grabbed another wine glass, and returned to the kitchen to place it in the dishwasher. Kevin continued to open additional cabinets in the kitchen throughout Emma's task.

The actions indicate that Kevin completed his goals in the living room and continued searching various kitchen cabinets, while Emma successfully placed wine glasses inside the dishwasher.
