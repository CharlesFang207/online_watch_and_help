Liam opened a cabinet, while Olivia walked into the kitchen. He then walked to another kitchen cabinet before asking, "Do you know where the bread and juice are?" Olivia replied, "I found bread inside several kitchen cabinets: 207, 209, 205, and 204. There's also some bread inside a cabinet in the bedroom. As for the juice, it's inside kitchen cabinet 209 and inside the microwave."

Liam walked over to the juice cabinet and grabbed a juice bottle. Olivia walked to the kitchen counter and opened another cabinet before grabbing a carrot and some bread. Liam put the juice in the fridge, while Olivia placed a carrot on the counter and grabbed more bread.

Liam opened the microwave and grabbed another juice bottle, heading to the fridge to put it in. Olivia placed the bread on the counter and grabbed a carrot. Liam grabbed a piece of bread from another location and put it into the fridge as Olivia returned to place the last of the bread and carrots on the counter.
