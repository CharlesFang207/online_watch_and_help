Kevin walked into the kitchen while Alice did the same. Then, Kevin moved towards the kitchen cabinet and asked, "Could you possibly tell me where the juice and spoon are?" Alice, grabbing a wineglass, responded, "I noticed the juice and a spoon inside the kitchen cabinet." Kevin walked to the wineglass, while Alice walked to the dishwasher. Kevin then walked to another wineglass and grabbed it, while Alice opened the dishwasher.

Kevin walked to the kitchen table and placed the wineglass on it, while Alice grabbed the coffeepot. Kevin then walked to the spoon, grabbed it, and placed it on the kitchen table, while Alice put the coffeepot inside the dishwasher. Kevin walked back to the kitchen cabinet and opened it. He grabbed the juice and placed it on the kitchen table.
