Kevin walked to a wineglass, grabbed it, and then moved to a mug, picking it up as well. He walked to the bathroom and then to the kitchen, where he put the wineglass on the kitchen table. Meanwhile, Emma didn’t take any action in the initial steps.

Kevin continued by grabbing another wineglass and placing it on the table. He checked the kitchen cabinets and fridge multiple times, seeming confused. "Do you know where the spoon is?" Kevin finally asked. Emma responded, "I found a spoon inside the kitchen cabinet and another one inside the fridge, both in the kitchen," but she didn’t take any physical action.

Kevin kept moving between the kitchen cabinets and fridge repeatedly, looking for the spoons Emma mentioned. He seemed to struggle to find what he was looking for, while Emma remained passive throughout this sequence.
