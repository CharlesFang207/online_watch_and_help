Mike walked into the kitchen as Linda followed him. He opened a kitchen cabinet and grabbed a juice. "Do you know where the beer and juice are?" he asked. "I found beer inside the kitchen cabinet, and there is also juice inside the stove and another juice inside the kitchen cabinet," Linda replied, as she opened the cabinet and the dishwasher.

Mike put the juice in the fridge while Linda checked the microwave and moved to the living room. Mike grabbed another juice from the cabinet, put it in the fridge, and continued searching the cabinets. Linda re-entered the kitchen and opened the stove, grabbing bread and a potato before putting them in the fridge.

Mike walked to the bathroom, opened the cabinet, then moved to the bedroom and grabbed a beer. Returning to the kitchen, he placed the beer in the fridge as Linda found another bread and put it in the fridge as well. Mike walked back to the bedroom, grabbed another beer, and repeated the process, while Linda did the same with the remaining potato.

Finally, Mike put the last beer in the fridge, while Linda placed the last potato inside as well.
