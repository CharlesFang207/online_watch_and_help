Alex walked into the kitchen, followed closely by Olivia. He then went to the bedroom and called out, "Could you help me find the milk and bread? I seem to have misplaced them." Olivia replied, "The milk and bread are both inside the kitchen cabinet," as she grabbed a carrot.

Alex returned to the kitchen and began searching through multiple cabinets. Olivia placed the carrot on the kitchen counter and opened the fridge. She then grabbed a potato and continued to the counter, putting it down before grabbing another potato.

Alex found the bread, walked to the fridge, and put it inside. Olivia continued gathering potatoes and placing them on the counter while Alex checked more kitchen appliances like the dishwasher and microwave.

Alex returned briefly to the bedroom, then continued through the kitchen, living room, and back into the kitchen. After opening more cabinets, he finally found the milk, walked to the fridge, and put it inside alongside the bread. Olivia finished her task by placing the last of the potatoes and carrots neatly on the counter.
