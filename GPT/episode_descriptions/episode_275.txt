Michael opened the microwave with Sarah immediately walking to the kitchen. Michael proceeded to the fridge, while Sarah grabbed a coffeepot. She brought the coffeepot to the dishwasher and placed it inside, while Michael moved to the kitchen cabinet and opened it. Grabbing a spoon, he walked to the kitchen table, placing the spoon there.

    Michael then asked, "Can you help me find the wine and the spoon?" Sarah replied, "I found some wine inside the kitchen cabinet, but I'm not sure if there's more elsewhere. As for the spoon, it's also in the kitchen cabinet, but I don't know if there are others as well."

    Michael continued searching various kitchen cabinets and even occasionally wandered to the bathroom and bedroom in his search. Meanwhile, Sarah put a wineglass inside the dishwasher and grabbed another coffeepot, placing that in the dishwasher as well. 

    Michael opened the stove, but not finding anything, he continued his search in the kitchen. Eventually, he found the wine in the fridge and placed it on the kitchen table.
