Kevin grabbed a wineglass and placed it on the kitchen table while Alice grabbed another wineglass. Kevin then walked to the living room as Alice walked to the mug. Kevin returned to the kitchen while Alice grabbed the mug and walked to the bathroom. "Could you help me find the spoon?" Kevin asked as he walked to the microwave. "I spotted a spoon inside the microwave in the kitchen, and also saw a few in the kitchen cabinet," Alice responded while walking to the bedroom. Kevin opened the kitchen cabinet as Alice walked to the kitchen. Kevin grabbed a spoon from the cabinet and placed it on the kitchen table while Alice put the wineglass on the kitchen table. Finally, Kevin finished his task as Alice walked to the stove.
