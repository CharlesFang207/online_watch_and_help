Kevin walked to a carrot and grabbed it as Emily entered the kitchen, asking, "Could you help me find the beer and the carrot?" Emily responded, "There's a beer in the stove and another in a kitchen cabinet. There are also carrots in that same cabinet."

Kevin took the carrot to the fridge and put it inside. Emily grabbed a milk carton and placed it on the kitchen table. Kevin opened several kitchen cabinets and walked to grab the beer. Emily grabbed a beer and put it on the kitchen table.

Kevin placed the beer in the fridge and walked to the living room, then back to the kitchen. Emma retrieved a wineglass from a cabinet and put it on the kitchen table. Kevin went to the bathroom, checked the cabinet, then returned to the kitchen to grab another beer.

Kevin grabbed another carrot from a cabinet and placed it in the fridge. Emily put another beer on the kitchen table. Kevin placed the second beer into the fridge. Emily then walked to the living room, grabbed a beer, and placed it on the kitchen table.
