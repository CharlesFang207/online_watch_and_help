# NOPA: Neurally-guided Online Probabilistic Assistance for Building Socially Intelligent Home Assistants

This is the official implementation of the paper [*NOPA: Neurally-guided Online Probabilistic Assistance for Building Socially Intelligent Home Assistants*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05223). 


In this work, we study how to build socially intelligent robots to assist people in their homes. In particular, we focus on assistance with online goal inference, where robots must simultaneously infer humans' goals and how to help them achieve those goals. For that, we propose **NOPA** (Neurally-guided Online Probabilistic Assistance), a method that predicts a set of goals given some observed human behavior and assist the human by taking actions based on the uncertainty of the inferred goal. 

To test this framework, we compare our method against multiple baselines in a new embodied AI assistance challenge: Online Watch-And-Help, in which a helper agent needs to simultaneously watch a main agent's action, infer its goal, and help perform a common household task faster in realistic virtual home environments.
